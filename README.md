# GII Generic Drivers

## CGroup Driver
CGroup Driver is developed to improve distribution of resources among groups of tasks and processes running in the infrastructure. The user can easily allow or deny access to the resources of the system online. The user is in control of how to allocate, for example CPU time, system memory, network bandwidth, or a combination of these resources - among user-defined groups of tasks (processes) running on the system. CGroup Driver tracks and collects specific statistics for each CGroup.

## Cisco Telemetry Driver
Running on a push model and providing near real-time access to operational statistics for monitoring data, Cisco Telemetry Driver represents a highly-productive tool for data streaming from an MDT-capable device to a destination node required. implementing. Bonus feature contains the ability to subscribe to the data by using standards-based YANG data models over open protocols.

## Juniper Telemetry Driver
Collects operational metrics for monitoring the network status with no scaling limitations. Juniper Telemetry Driver gives the network administrators the opportunity to follow real-time data streaming, measure the trends in links and follow up the node performance. The features on troubleshooting such issues as network congestion in real time and setting the frequency of the data collection depending on user’s monitoring needs and retention policies provide you with the extra mobility and adaptivity.

## CPU Driver
CPU Driver is called for tracking metrics about CPU performance by means of collecting, reviewing memory and disk usage. Relying on it, the user can gather metrics, easily add memory, disk and a whole host of other metrics, receiving a complete picture of your environment’s performance. Simple in configuring, CPU Driver can be set to report per CPU stats or not, whether to report total system CPU stats or not, collect raw CPU time metrics, and then compute and report on the sum of all non-idle CPU states. It is an informative tool for better management of the resources in hand. 

## Disk Driver
The main purpose of this very tool is to ensure that your applications or processes will not fail due to insufficient disk storage, which could lead to other failures. 
Actively monitoring your free disk space using the Disk Driver — an input driver — can prevent data loss, server downtime and failures by being alerted promptly when disk space availability is beyond specified critical thresholds.
Easy use, instant collecting disk storage metrics and customization of the thresholds create a mighty tool for keeping track of hard disk usage of your web servers, application servers, file servers and much more. 

## DNS Query Driver
The key feature of the driver is its efficiency. Gathering DNS query times in milliseconds, the DNS Query Driver guarantees that the Domain Name System continues to route traffic properly to your websites, services, and electronic communications.    
Configuring the DNS Query Driver requires defining the network protocol, domain, port, and query timeout. You can start collecting DNS Query metrics to help you understand performance. You can set thresholds and send alerts to avoid any issues with DNS routing.

## Bond Driver
Irreplaceable element to protect that virtualized environment from loss of service due to a disaster at a single point of failure or physical link. Being very helpful in terms of increasing not only the network throughput and bandwidth, it's also ideal when looking for fault tolerance, when load balancing networks and more. Bond Driver provides the user with the insight throughout the whole network, collecting metrics so the user is aware which interface is active, what the state of the bond interface is, and if there are any failures. By default, the Bond Driver collects metrics from all bond interfaces, but you can restrict the metrics to specified bond interfaces.

## Ethtool Driver
Utility program, gathering metrics on your Ethernet devices connected to your Linux system. Its goal is to help the user to troubleshoot Ethernet-card-related problems on a Linux system.
The Ethtool Driver pulls ethernet device stats. Metrics pulled are dependent on the network device and driver. Configuration of this input driver is simple: list the metrics you want or you want to ignore. Once you have set this configuration, then point the driver to your instance to start gathering metrics.
